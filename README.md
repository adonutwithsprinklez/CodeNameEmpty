# Codename: Empty

## Overview

Codename: Empty is the pet project I initially created in highschool. Since its initial appearance, it has gone through numerous rewrites and restarts. This is its current form.

Codename:Empty is a textbased-adventure-roguelite game. There are few games like it that I am aware of. Unlike most textbased-adventure games, this one has taken numerous elements from the popular roguelike genre. Procedural generation of content will play a large role in how the game plays.

Currently the game is in a pre-playable demo stage, but huge strides have set it forward towards being an enjoyable experience. I am excited that others will soon be able to play the game it was always meant to be.

Yes, I plan on renaming the project down the road.

## Features (Mostly up and coming)

* A full fledged textbased adventure

  There is a certain magic to textbased games that others cannot match. Codename: Empty attempts to push the text-adventure genre to a new level.

* Massive amounts of content

  The game engine has been designed around the ability to both handcraft and procedurally generate content. From procedurally generated weapons, events, and places, to handcrafted quests, armors, and NPCs, there will be a host of things to do.
  
* Easy Moddability

  The game engine loads data from "data packs". These packs are made up of json files and are not compiled directly into the executable. This means that even if someone has no coding skills, new content can easily be added without having to worry about touching Python code or making sure the compile script works on their own machine.
  
  At the same time, all of the source code is going to be hosted here. Want to mess around with how the combat system works? Head on into the source and change it to your heart's content. The only thing needed to compile is an installation of Python 3.
  
* It Is Free
  
  The game is free. Forever. The dist folder contains a compiled version of the game, that _should_ be upto date in terms of content, and all of the game's source code is in the src folder.

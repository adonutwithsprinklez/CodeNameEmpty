FOCUS:
	- Easy moddability
		The game is built around the idea that all objects should be modifiable from their respecting json files. This will allow anyone to easily add to the game.
	- Lots of replayability
		An easy to understand game that will have lots of content for those that want to master it.
	- Short play sessions (15-30 minutes)
		The player has a single life and will not live long, but in that time he/she will learn how to survive longer everytime. This will give the player a reason to get better.
	- Very random
		Nearly every part of the actual content of the game will have random aspects to them, from minor name changes to major stat effects. This will increase replayability.
